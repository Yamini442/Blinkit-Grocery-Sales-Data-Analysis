# Blinkit-Grocery-Sales-Data-Analysis
## Project Objective
To perform a comprehensive grocery sales analysis for Blinkit using SQL, Python, and Power BI independently, with the goal of uncovering actionable insights related to customer preferences, category-level sales trends, and inventory distribution.
## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (SQL Server)** – Data querying, filtering, aggregations, joins, and window functions
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy)** – Data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards with slicers, filters, and KPI cards
  
## KPIs

**Total Sales Revenue** – Overall income generated from grocery orders

**Average Sales per Transaction** – Mean revenue per individual order

**Total Quantity Sold** – Number of grocery items sold

**Top-Selling Products** – Products with highest revenue and volume

**Average Product Rating** – Reflects customer satisfaction

**Sales by Category** – Revenue contribution segmented by product category

**Sales by Fat Content** – Insights into customer preferences by fat levels

## Process

**Data Preparation**: Cleaned and structured the dataset using SQL and Python (pandas).

**SQL Analysis**: Extracted key KPIs and trends using aggregation, filtering, and joins.

**Python Analysis**: Conducted exploratory analysis and created visualizations using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

**Power BI Dashboard**: Built an interactive dashboard to visualize sales performance, product trends, and outlet insights.

## Project Insights
Total sales reached $1.2M, with over 8,500 items sold, highlighting a moderately scaled grocery operation.
- Supermarket Type 1 outlets dominated performance, contributing $787.5K, indicating they are the most profitable retail format.
- Low Fat products led category sales with $776.3K, suggesting a strong customer preference for health-focused options.
- Top-selling product categories included Fruits, Snack Foods, Household, and Frozen Foods, essential for inventory prioritization.
- Medium-sized outlets outperformed others with $507.9K in revenue, indicating the optimal store format for customer engagement.
- Tier 3 cities generated $472.1K in sales, demonstrating significant market potential in smaller urban regions.
- Average product rating was 4.0, reflecting generally positive customer satisfaction levels.
- Sales declined sharply from $204.5K in 2018 to $129.1K in 2020, with only a slight recovery to $131.5K by 2022, pointing to business challenges and the need for strategic intervention.
## Conclusion
 This analysis demonstrates the effective use of SQL, Python, and Power BI to extract, analyze, and visualize grocery sales data. It uncovered key trends such as declining sales over time, strong performance of low-fat products, and the dominance of supermarket-type outlets. The project highlights how multi-tool analytics can drive actionable insights to support retail strategy and operational decisions.
